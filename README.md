## Depth Estimation in monocular images using Modified Stacked Generalization
This project is a part of the coursework done in the course "Image Processing" during my 5th semester. This project is an implementation of the algorithm discussed in the research paper [Depth estimation from single images using modified stacked generalization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299485061_Poster-Depth_estimation_from_single_images_using_modified_stacked_generalization). 
It has been implemented using **Matlab**.
## Dataset
[The dataset](http://make3d.cs.cornell.edu/data.html) consists of 400 training images and and 134 testing images, along with their depth maps. Since the image resolution of this image dataset was to high to process, we reduced the resolution to feed it to the Neural network efficiently with lesser time to learn from the dataset.
